# Data Analysis and Visualization Projects using Python by FreeCodeCamp
 
The repository is a collection of 6 sub-projects on datasets and problems from freecodecamp.org. The repository is just my approach to the datasets and problemsets; also excluding the unit tests and other modules provided by freecodecamp.

A brief description of the dataset and problem sets are:


1. **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator:** A simple function to calculate summary statistics of a list of numbers using the Numpy library.

2. **Demographic Data Analyzer:** Basic inferences from the demographic dataset extracted from the 1994 Census database.

3. **Medical Data Visualizer:** Visualizing a medical dataset with body information of patients along with basic analytical operations on the dataset such as data cleaning, data normalization, deriving features, and so on.

4. **Page View Time Series Visualizer:** Visualizing time series data from freecodecamp's website view dataset and performing basic analytical operations such as data cleaning, reformatting datasets and so on.

5. **Sea Level Predictor:** A simple predictor function using linear regression on CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level dataset and predicting the sea level for 2050 based on the whole data and current trends. 

6. **Sales Data Analysis:** Visualizing a sales dataset using different forms of visualization along with performing basic analytical operations using the Pandas library.
